Hi there ðŸ‘‹! 

My name is **Max**. I am a full stack web developer with 8 years of experience in the industry. My area of expertise is in PHP and JavaScript, and I have a strong passion for creating dynamic and engaging web solutions. I am highly skilled in developing robust, scalable, and efficient applications that deliver an outstanding user experience.

I am committed to using industry standards and best practices, and I always strive to write high-level, clean, and maintainable code. I am proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, utilizing frameworks and libraries, such as ReactJS and Symfony to streamline the development process. I have a deep understanding of databases, server-side architecture and methodology.

But aside from coding, I have a true passion for tea! I believe that a good cup of tea is essential to a productive day and can help bring clarity to even the most challenging problems. Whether I'm enjoying a warm, comforting brew or a crisp, refreshing glass of iced tea, I find that tea helps me stay focused and inspired.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and keeping up with the latest technology trends. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and push my limits as a developer. I believe that continuous learning and self-improvement are crucial to success in this field.

It's great to meet you! Speaking of tea ðŸ«–, I think my cup is ready... so if you'll excuse me, I need to go brew up some inspiration! ðŸ˜‰
