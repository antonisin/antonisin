Hi there 👋! 

My name is Max. I’m a senior backend-focused engineer with 10+ years in the industry, building scalable services, APIs, and internal platforms. My core stack is TypeScript/Node.js (NestJS) and PHP (Symfony), and I enjoy turning complex requirements into clean, reliable systems.

I’m committed to engineering discipline — standards, best practices, and solid methodology. I care about system design, microservices, API design (REST/gRPC), integrations, and production readiness: performance, reliability, and code that stays maintainable over time. I’m also comfortable working across the stack when needed (React), but my strongest area is backend architecture and delivery.

But aside from coding, I have a true passion for tea! I believe that a good cup of tea is essential to a productive day and can help bring clarity to even the most challenging problems. Whether I'm enjoying a warm, comforting brew or a crisp, refreshing glass of iced tea, I find that tea helps me stay focused and inspired.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and keeping up with the latest technology trends. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and push my limits as a developer. I believe that continuous learning and self-improvement are crucial to success in this field.

It's great to meet you! Speaking of tea 🫖, I think my cup is ready... so if you'll excuse me, I need to go brew up some inspiration! 😉
